<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I'm Ouroboros, a cryptic setter from the UK. While my grids are not yet found</p>
<p>in any physical publications, I aim to change that in the near future. This</p>
<p>site is still largely a work in progress, but will be updated with new grids on</p>
<p>a frequent basis. While I currently have no strict uploading schedule, I'm</p>
<p>aiming for around one new grid a week. Grids found here include standard 15x15s</p>
<p>(which may or may not contain themes), Jumbo 21x21 grids which generally include</p>
<p>either thematic surfaces or entries, and my own creation - a non-themed 4x4 which</p>
<p>I've dubbed the "Cryptitchy".</p>
<br>
<p>Most of my grids are aimed at experienced solvers, so don't feel too disheartened</p>
<p>if you find yourself hitting a wall. I aim to add some beginner-level grids in</p>
<p>the future, and possibly even publish some beginner's guides. I'm also working</p>
<p>on expanding into barred 13x13s, with one grid in the works. These barred grids</p>
<p>will (naturally) include rare and obscure words, as well as special instructions</p>
<p>governing the solving and entering of clues.</p>
