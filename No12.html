  exolve-preamble:
    Six consecutive entries, when placed in their positions, create a visual representation of the
theme.
  exolve-explanations:
    Many entries are themed around Terry Pratchett and his Discworld novels, a series in which the number <b>EIGHT</b> has magical properties. The first two across entries spell <b>MISTER TEATIME</b>, a Discworld character. A more central character (both literally and figuratively) is <b>DEATH</b>, whose job is to <b>REAP</b>. His rodent counterpart is the Death of <b>RATS</b>, who has an <b>AVIFORM</b> companion. In the novel <b>SOUL</b> Music, he joins the Klatchian Foreign Legion (as a <b>FOREIGNER</b>, no doubt) and receives a name which is a homophone of <b>BONE IDLE</b>.
<br>
<br>
A further example of Pratchett putting his <b>IDEAS</b> on <b>A/PAGE</b> (demonstrated literally in the grid) is in the novel <b>GOOD OMENS</b>.
<br>
<br>
The bottom third of the grid provides a literal representation of Discworld: A <b>FICTIONAL DISC</b> atop <b>FOUR ELEPHANTS</b>, resting on an <b>IMMENSE TURTLE</b>
