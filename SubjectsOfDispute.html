  exolve-preamble:
    The Across clues are all standard cryptic offerings. Fourteen of the Down clues each contain a deliberate, single-letter misprint in the definition. The incorrect letters in clue order will spell out two proper nouns which, along with a Down entry, were all subjects of a dispute between two Across entries. Letters may become capitalised or decapitalised as the misprinted definitions are corrected.
