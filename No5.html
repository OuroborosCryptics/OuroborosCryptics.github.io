  exolve-preamble:
    Two consecutive entries are thematically linked. The first of these entries is additionally linked to every other entry that shares its enumeration, according to a second theme.
  exolve-explanations:
    First theme: 1d: INTEGRAL and 2d: DERIVATIVE are the products of <i>integration</i> and <i>differentiation</i>, two inversely related functions in calculus.
<br>
<br>
Second theme: 1d: INTEGRAL is an anagram of all other eight-letter entries: 11a: ALTERING, 12a: TRIANGLE, 23a: RELATING, 24a: ALERTING, 20d: TANGLIER
